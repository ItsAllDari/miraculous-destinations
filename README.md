<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>I plan to begin with the backend of Django and setting up the models, serializers and URLs. I will be sure to run curl scripts for all of the CRUD actions and follow a methodical order to complete the project. I plan to then move to the front end and set up all of the client side interface so that it can read the data from the backend. Ending with styling of the application.</p>
